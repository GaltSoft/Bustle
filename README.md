# Bustle Project

Open Source Project to explore Server Side Swift and other emerging Swift Technologies

It implements the classic ToDo app that is in a large variety of demos

## Technology Stack

Swift
Kitura

## How ?

The project is just getting off the ground.  But you can actually see a server written is Swift service HTTP requests from an iOS App.  Set break points in Xcode and see how it works. 

1) Start Couchbase so it is listening on port 5984

2) Server (BustleServer Directory) open it in Xcode and run it 

3) App (BustleApp Directory) open it in Xcode an run it.

## More details
This project has started out as the merging of two other projects. More details can be found at the original project's readme.
